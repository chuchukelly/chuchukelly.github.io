Hi, I’m Nuo (Kelly) Xu, an undergraduate student at Rutgers University–New Brunswick, double majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. I am broadly interested in machine learning, with a focus on building trustworthy, fair, and privacy-preserving AI systems. My research explores how we can ensure that data-driven technologies are statistically sound, socially responsible, and aligned with human values.

You can find my CV here:[Kelly Xu CV](../assets/Kelly Xu CV.pdf).
